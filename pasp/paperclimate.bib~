  abstract={The area of Chajnantor, at more than 5000 m altitude in northern Chile, offers unique atmospheric and operational conditions which arguably make it the best site in the world for millimeter, submillimeter, and mid-infrared observatories. Long-term monitoring of the precipitable water vapor (PWV) column on the Chajnantor plateau has shown its extreme dryness with annual median values of 1.1 mm. Simultaneous measurements of PWV on the Chajnantor plateau (5050 m) and on Cerro Chajnantor (5612 m) show that the latter is around 36% lower under normal atmospheric conditions and up to 80% lower than the plateau in the presence of temperature inversion layers. Recently, the Government of Chile has consolidated the creation of the Parque Astronómico de Atacama (Atacama Astronomical Park), an initiative of the Chilean Commission for Science and Technology (CONICYT). This new park offers an opportunity for national and international projects to settle within its boundaries, gain access to an extremely dry site that is suitable for observations over a broad spectral range, especially in the millimeter to mid-infrared wavelengths, and benefit from operational and logistical support within a secure legal framework.}

abstract="Due to the demand for high-speed wireless communications, carrier frequencies have increased in the search for both available and wider bands. The millimeter-wave and terahertz bands (0.1--3 THz) are commonly believed to be impractical for all but short-range links due to severe attenuation by atmospheric water vapor. However, the field of submillimeter radio astronomy has demonstrated that this can be effectively mitigated by the construction of large aperture telescopes in very dry high-altitude locations, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Chilean Andes. Modeling has shown that Earth-satellite links in excess of 1 Tb per second can be achieved with a system patterned off observatories, since the loss of a satellite link from a dry location equals a sea-level path of only several kilometers. Despite advantages over optical satellite links, THz links have not been an area of active study. We review the technology and science necessary to develop a terabit-per-second THz satellite link and argue that a satellite link offers a good first step toward the development of ubiquitous THz communications.",

abstract = "Abstract The water vapor continuum absorption spectrum was investigated using Fourier Transform Spectroscopy. The transmission of broadband terahertz radiation from 0.300 to 1.500 \{THz\} was recorded for multiple path lengths and relative humidity levels. The absorption coefficient as a function of frequency was determined and compared with theoretical predictions and available water vapor absorption data. The prediction code is able to separately model the different parts of atmospheric absorption for a range of experimental conditions. A variety of conditions were accurately modeled using this code including both self and foreign gas broadening for low and high water vapor pressures for many different measurement techniques. The intensity and location of the observed absorption lines were also in good agreement with spectral databases. However, there was a discrepancy between the resonant line spectrum simulation and the observed absorption spectrum in the atmospheric transmission windows caused by the continuum absorption. A small discrepancy remained even after using the best available data from the literature to account for the continuum absorption. From the experimental and resonant line simulation spectra the air-broadening continuum parameter was calculated and compared with values available in the literature. "

year={2001},
volume={49},
number={12},
pages={1683-1694},
abstract={We present a model of the longwave atmospheric spectrum that improves in many respects widely used older models such as the microwave propagation model (MPM), since it is based on broadband measurements and calculations. According to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 THz while including lines up to 10 THz. Its primary goal is to simulate the millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up to ~2 THz at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 THz accessible only under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species. The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms based on FTS measurements between 170 and 1100 GHz: collision-induced absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric molecules (N 2 and O2) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All H2O lines up to 10 THz are included in order to correctly account for the entire H2O far-wing opacity below 2 THz for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models used to date. Phase delays near H2O and O2 resonances are also important for ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array (ALMA) project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at microwaves (ATM) has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy},

abstract = "We present broadband atmospheric transmission spectra obtained on Mauna Kea, Hawaii (4100 m. above sea level) on \{UT\} April 1st, 1998 and July 1st, 1999 under very similar pressure and temperature conditions. The 1998 measurements occurred under conditions of extremely low atmospheric water vapor, with a ground-level relative humidity of ≈2%. As a result of its dryness the Mauna Kea site allows access to a partially transparent atmosphere up to frequencies exceeding 1000 GHz, where the relative importance of atmospheric continuum-like absorption is much larger than at millimeter wavelengths, and hence easier to measure. As shown in this paper, these conditions have allowed us to measure and separate the submillimeter absorption spectrum into three terms: resonant lines, non-resonant absorption of the dry atmosphere due to collision-induced mechanisms involving electric quadrupoles, and continuum-like water vapor opacity. The spectra presented here were obtained with a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and cover a continuous frequency range from 350 to 1100 GHz, with a finest spectral resolution of 200 MHz. The 1998 conditions were so exceptionally dry that an atmospheric window centered at 1035 \{GHz\} showed up to 35% zenith transmission. The calibration of our data is especially careful and includes corrections for differences between the ground atmospheric temperature and the calibrator temperature, as well as for the tropospheric temperature lapse rate, and the water vapor scale height. This procedure is able to yield transmission spectra calibrated to within 1–2%. A multilayer atmospheric radiative transfer model has been used for data analysis. "

abstract="This paper presents the first results from a prototype infrared radiometer which has been developed to measure variations in atmospheric water vapor column abundance from high altitude sites. The performance of the infrared radiometer is compared and contrasted with that of a water vapor monitor operating at radio frequencies. Analysis shows that the infrared radiometer can measure variations at the level of ∼ 1 $\mu$m precipitable water vapor (pwv) in an integration time of 1 s when the total column abundance is ∼0.5 mm pwv. Since variations in atmospheric water vapor are the dominant source of phase noise in (sub)millimeter astronomical interferometry, an instrument capable of rapid and high sensitivity water vapor measurements has the potential to provide the necessary phase correction information for interferometric arrays.",

	abstract = {The use of T-rays, or terahertz radiation, to identify substances by their spectroscopic fingerprints is a rapidly moving field. The dominant approach is presently terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. However, a key problem is that ambient water vapour is ubiquitous and the consequent water absorption distorts the T-ray pulses. Water molecules in the gas phase selectively absorb incident T-rays at discrete frequencies corresponding to their molecular rotational transitions. When T-rays propagate through an atmosphere, this results in prominent resonances spread over the T-ray spectrum; furthermore, in the time domain, fluctuations after the main pulse are observed in the T-ray signal. These effects are generally undesired, since they may mask critical spectroscopic data. So, ambient water vapour is commonly removed from the T-ray path by using a closed chamber during the measurement. Yet, in some applications, a closed chamber is not always feasible. This situation, therefore, motivates the need for an optional alternative method for reducing these unwanted artefacts. This paper represents a study on a computational means that is a step towards addressing the problem arising from water vapour absorption over a moderate propagation distance. Initially, the complex frequency response of water vapour is modelled from a spectroscopic catalogue. Using a deconvolution technique, together with fine tuning of the strength of each resonance, parts of the water vapour response are removed from a measured T-ray signal, with minimal signal distortion, thus providing experimental validation of the technique.},

abstract = "Abstract We study the fundamental limits of detection for astrophysical observations in the far infrared. Understanding these fundamental limits is critical to the planning and analysis of experiments in this region. We specifically characterize the difficulties associated with observing in the 0.1–10 \{THz\} (30–3000 μm) regime including extraterrestrial, atmospheric, and optical emission. We present signal, noise, and integration time models for selected terrestrial, aircraft, balloon, and space missions. While ground based telescopes offer the great advantage of aperture size, and hence angular resolution, they suffer from the relatively low transmission and high radiance of the atmosphere, particularly for wavelengths less than 500 μm. Space telescopes are the inverse; they are limited by a small aperture, while an aircraft-borne telescope is constrained by both. Balloon-borne telescopes provide an option over much of the band. A quantitative understanding of this is critical in comparing the sensitivity of various experiments and in planning the next generation of missions. As representative sources we use the luminous far-IR dusty galaxies \{NGC\} 958 and Mrk 231, but the same formalism can be applied to any source. In this paper we focus on continuum emission while a future paper will focus on line emission. "

  abstract={For a systematic assessment of submillimeter observing conditions at different sites, we constructed tipping radiometers to measure the broad band atmospheric transparency in the window around 350 μ m wavelength. The tippers were deployed on Maunakea, Hawaii, at the South Pole, and in the vicinity of Cerro Chajnantor in northern Chile. Identical instruments permit direct comparison of these sites. Observing conditions at the South Pole and in the Chajnantor area are better than on Maunakea. Simultaneous measurements with two tippers demonstrate conditions at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor are significantly better than on the Chajnantor plateau.}
